# Classify-Radio-Communicational-Signals-from-Space-using-Keras
# Motivation Behind this project:
This project classifies the radio signals recorded from Outer Space. The Convolution Neural Network(CNN) model is developed using keras library, and Tensorflow as back-end.
#Today's military operations depend on extensive use of wireless communication technologies.
#An important element in many WIRELESS COMMUNICATION activities is distinguishing between different radio signals.
# In this project Dataset istaken dataset from https://seti.org/ (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI))

Here we have taken 4 class labels for Radio signals that are Squiggle, Narrowband, Noise, Narrowbanded
