# Classify-Radio-Communicational-Signals-from-Space-using-Keras
This project classifies the radio signals from Outer Space. The Convolution Neural Network(CNN) model is developed using keras library.
#Today's military operations depend on extensive use of wireless communication technologies
#An important element in many WIRELESS COMMUNICATION activities is distinguishing between different radio signals.
# In this project I have taken dataset from https://seti.org/ (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI))
